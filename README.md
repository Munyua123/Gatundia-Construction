We will also have a Navbar.

it will also have a card with a photo of the machines being hired and a button that when you press it takes you to a page where you can book it.

**Projects**
It will have a section with a title, and a small description of the project and pictures from the projects that have already been done.

**Products**
It will have a card with the products, the cards will be from bootstrap.
